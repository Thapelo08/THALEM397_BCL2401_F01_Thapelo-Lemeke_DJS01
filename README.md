### DJS01: Mars Climate Orbiter Challenge

The Mars Climate Orbiter incident in 1999 is a stark reminder of the importance of precision in space missions, highlighting how a simple unit mismatch led to the loss of the spacecraft. This challenge seeks to simulate similar challenges in a spacecraft navigation system, emphasising the need for accuracy in calculations.

#### Challenge Overview

This challenge invites students to debug, refactor, and enhance JavaScript functions designed for determining the trajectory of a spacecraft. The initial functions are flawed and may result in incorrect calculations.



This code calculates new velocity, distance, and remaining fuel based on given parameters. Follow the instructions below to debug and improve the code:

1. **Make the code more readable by**
   - Using meaningful variable names.
   - Adding comments to explain the purpose of each calculation.

2. **Pick up calculation errors by**
   - Ensuring consistent units of measurement.
   - Checking for potential division by zero errors.
   - Verifying the correctness of mathematical operations.

3. **Make these calculations robust such that**
   - Errors are caught and appropriate error messages are displayed to the user.
   - Input parameters are validated to prevent incorrect usage.

**Given Parameters**
- vel: velocity (km/h)
- acc: acceleration (m/s^2)
- time: time duration (seconds)
- d: initial distance (km)
- fuel: remaining fuel (kg)
- fbr: fuel burn rate (kg/s)

**CHALLENGES**
-The results were not appearing on the terminal but only when i "go live" they appeared on the console.
